What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
I think the most challenging part was to make all the components fit with each other and make the webpages cohesive. I also think the navbar was challenging to design but I also had difficulty working with grid overall. Once I had the navbar in place, I think working with HTML and CSS was somewhat in the medium difficulty for me since I've never worked with either of them. I had difficulty with importing a font? It wasn't working so I just made the font-family to be sans-serif. The assignment took me about 5 days, maybe 10 hours? I was not keeping track of the time and some of the time was spent choosing color schemes or playing around on canva to make a little logo for fun.

What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I used @media to make the colors of my headers to change based on screen size. I also played around with grid on my hobbies page where the boxes will stack on top of each other when mobile.

What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
I tried to take in account the padding/margins of the page, and how I could make my paragraphs, photos, boxes line up. I also kept to a silly pink/yellow theme just for fun. I guess I'm proud of the nav bar and my about me page.

Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
I would add more photos or videos, and maybe some fun animations if I knew how.

How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I might have spent around 10 hours on it?

(Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?
I think I assumed it would've been more difficult to make a website, but I felt that it was doable given what we've learned in class and the resources I had to look up on my own (mostly on MDN, W3, and youtube). I also assumed that the navbar was going to be the more involved part of the project which I still think was accurate.

If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here.  Furthermore, if you imported a file to use a Fonts or Icons library, please indicate that here as well.
I learned how to use the pseudoclass, :active, in my contact me page. I learned how to use it on W3 page.
